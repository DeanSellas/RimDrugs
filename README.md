# RimDrugs
A mod that adds drugs to RimWorld.

## IMPORTANT

Due to the recent announcement by Ludeon Studios about Alpha 15 and them adding a new drug system to the game this mod will be indefinitely discontinued. I knew that this was going to happen evenutally but I did not think it would come this soon. While I am a little upset that this did happen sooner than I anticipated which never allowed me to finished the mod, this was a great learning experience for me and now I will have time to put effort into thinking of new and better ideas for future mods. But that being said I am also happy that a idea that I had and was working on is being added to the game, and while yes this was not added because of me, but I know I had a good idea and was going in the right direction. And like I said this discontinuation is indefinite at this moment and I may come back to it later after seeing what Tynan adds to the game. The mod will still be available for download but I can not promise its stability in later versions of the game.

Thank you for your support,
